    prompt = f"""The user will give you an instruction, you have to transform it into a command that the player can execute. 
    The player is on a 15x15 tile map with different objects on some tiles.

    The player can do 3 different actions:
    - MOVE X,Y : move the player to the tile at position X,Y
    - PICK : pick up the object on the tile where the player is
    - DROP : drop the first object the player is holding

    You will get the following informations:
    - the player position (X,Y)
    - the position of the objects on the map

    INFORMATIONS:
    PLAYER POSITION: {player}
    OBJECTS POSITION: {objects}

    You must only answer with a command that the player can execute : MOVE X,Y, PICK or DROP.
    You must follow the format of the commands, for example: MOVE 1,2, PICK or DROP.
    You must provide a command that fits the best the user instruction.

    Example:
    USER_MESSAGE: Je veux que tu ailles Ã  la position 1,2
    COMMAND: MOVE 1,2
    
    Your turn to answer the user message:
    USER_MESSAGE: {user_message}
    COMMAND:
